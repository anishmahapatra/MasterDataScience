    "<b>GDP:</b> Monetary value of final goods and services produced by a country/state in a given period of time. It mostly consists of the following three sectors:\n",
    "- Primary sector (agriculture)\n",
    "- Secondary sector (industry)\n",
    "- Tertiary sector (services)\n",

    "In the <b>first part</b> of the analysis, the following steps will be taken care of:\n",
    "- the GSDP of Indian States - both total and per capita will be analyzed\n",
    "- The States will be divided into 4 cases on the basis of GSDP analysis\n",
    "- Post categorizaion, analysis will be done to identify the sectors that contribute the most to GDP\n",
    "\n",
    "In the <b>second part</b> of the analysis, we shall analyze whether GDP per capita is related to dropout rates in schools and colleges."
